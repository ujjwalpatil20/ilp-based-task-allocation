## Installation and Project Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:
- ROS2 Humble (Refer to the [Installation Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html))
- Git

### 1. Create a ROS Workspace

Create a new ROS workspace and initialize it (or use this repository as a workspace):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros_ws/src
cd ~/ros_ws/
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

### 2. Clone the Package

Navigate to the `src` directory of your workspace and clone the repository:

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/HBRS-SDP/ws24-multi-robot-task-distribution.git
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
pip install flask
```

### 4. Build the Package

Build the package using `colcon`:

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install
```

---

## Launching the System

To start the system, follow these steps:

### 1. Source the Workspace

Before launching any nodes, ensure the workspace is sourced:

```bash
source ~/ros_ws/install/setup.bash
```
### 2. Set the Number of Robots (Optional)
The system allows you to configure the number of robots by setting the NUM_OF_ROBOTS environment variable. This variable, **if not set, takes default value of 2**.

To set the number of robots, use the following command:
```bash
export NUM_OF_ROBOTS=4  # Replace 4 with the desired number of robots
```
This value will be used by the Simulation Environment and Warehouse Manager both to initialize the robot fleet, so ensure this variable is exported in all terminals before launching the system.

### 3. Launch the Simulation Environment

The simulation environment replicates a warehouse with 8 shelves and includes:
- **Gazebo**: For 3D simulation.
- **Map Server**: For navigation.
- **RViz**: For visualization (Optional).

Launch the simulation environment using:

```bash
ros2 launch simulation_env sim_with_nav.launch.py
```
Alternatively, to launch the simulation with RViz enabled, use this command:
```bash
ros2 launch simulation_env sim_with_nav.launch.py enable_rviz:=true
# The `enable_rviz` parameter, when set to `true`, launches RViz for visualizing the robots' navigation and tasks in real-time.
```
This launches usual simulation and additionally opens up RViz window for each robot for monitoring or testing individually.

### 4. Launch the Warehouse Manager

The Warehouse Manager initializes the core nodes required for the system. It includes:
- **Logger Node**: Logs simulation events and data.
- **Fleet Manager Node**: Manages the robot fleet, with the number of robots specified by the `num_of_robots` parameter.
- **Shared Memory Node**: Handles shared memory for inter-process communication.
- **Task Manager Node**: Distributes tasks among robots.

Run the following command to launch the Warehouse Manager:

```bash
ros2 launch simulation_env warehouse_manager.launch.py
```

### 5. Start the Web Client

The Web Client provides a graphical interface for managing orders and monitoring the system. It interacts with the Shared Memory to access data.

Navigate to the Web Server directory and start the server:

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws/src/ws24-multi-robot-task-distribution/src/web_server
./Server.py
```

Once started, access the Web Client through your browser to place orders and monitor the system in real-time.

## Architecture Overview
This architecture represents a **multi-robot task distribution system** with the following key components:

1. **Web Server**: Handles client orders via a GUI and interacts with Shared Memory for data access.
2. **Task Manager**: Processes order requests, queries the database, and uses a task allocation algorithm to assign tasks based on robot proximity, battery, and availability.
3. **Fleet Manager**: Manages robot statuses, aggregates fleet status, and assigns tasks to robots via a task assignment service.
4. **Robot Fleet**: Consists of multiple robots that navigate, pick up, and drop off parcels while reporting their status to the Fleet Manager.
5. **Shared Memory**: Stores and updates inventory, robot locations, and other critical data.
6. **Database**: Maintains shelf locations, capacities, inventory, robot locations, and order history.
7. **Central Logger**: Logs activities from the Task Manager, Fleet Manager, and Shared Memory for monitoring and debugging.

The system ensures efficient task distribution, real-time fleet monitoring, and seamless coordination between robots, tasks, and inventory management.

## Node Documentation

### 1. **Task Manager**

The **Task Manager** is responsible for receiving order details from the Web Server and assigning tasks to robots based on a Task Allocation Algorithm. It ensures efficient task distribution by considering the following parameters:
- **Availability**: Only idle robots are considered for task allocation.
- **Proximity**: Distance of the robot from the target shelf.
- **Battery Level**: Ensures robots with sufficient battery are prioritized.

#### Workflow:
1. Receives order details from the Web Server via a ROS2 service.
2. Evaluates all available robots using the Task Allocation Algorithm.
3. Assigns the task to the robot with the best score.
4. Sends the task details to the **Fleet Manager** for execution.

#### Communication:
- **Input**: Order details from the Web Server (via ROS2 service).
- **Output**: Task assignment to the Fleet Manager (via ROS2 service).

### 2. **Fleet Manager**

The **Fleet Manager** oversees the status of all robots and ensures smooth execution of assigned tasks. It acts as the intermediary between the Task Manager and the robots' navigation system.
